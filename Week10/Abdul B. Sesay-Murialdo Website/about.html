    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Murialdo Secondary School is located in Lunsar, along the main Freetown-Makeni Highway. This was not the original location of the School. The school was established in 1976 and was housed in the buildings the Delco Company had been using as Training Institute. When the company folded up and abandoned the buildings located along Port Loko Road, it dawned on Father Attilio Stefani, an Italian Xaverian Missionary, the necessity of opening a secondary school for boys in Lunsar. There  was already  a Secondary School for girls - Our Lady of Guadalupe Secondary School – in Lunsar

        The new school for boys was named after the mother of the then President of the Nation, Siaka P. Stevens, and was called Madam Miatta Stevens Science, Technical, Agricultural Secondary School. The running of the School was entrusted to a black American Principal, Mr. Samuel Massey, under the vigilant eye of Fr Stefani.
        
        The first set of Staff were mainly Josephites from Italy, India, and America with very few Sierra Leoneans. The foreign teachers were responsible for teaching Science and Technical subjects. But in 1985 the school had more of Sierra Leoneans staff teaching science and technical subjects. The school is Government assisted.
        
        In 1977 a team of St. Joseph Fathers and Brothers Congregation visited Lunsar. They were invited to Lunsar by Fr. Stefani. The Josephites that came and Fr. Stefani reached an immediate understanding for the taking over of the school by new religious family. The Josephites made a report on their findings to their General Superior in Rome. The outcome of it was the decision of sending three confreres who would immediately work in the newly established school. This took place in 1979. Of the three new comers, Fr. Anthony Maculan was entrusted with the Acting Principalship, while the other two immersed themselves in teaching and youth activities.
        
         From that moment on, it was a continuous growth in number of pupils and development of the structure until 1996, when the school compound, containing both the junior and senior sections of the school, was inaugurated by the Minister of Education, Dr. Alpha T. Wurie. Previous to that year, it should be narrated that, in 1982 a new separate building was started in the area where the school is now located.
        
        In 1996, the enrolment of students reached up to 846. In between we should narrate the sad story of the repeated disasters, which fell on the school because of the rebel war. They can be summarised by saying that the school lost all its equipment and means for performing its job. The last devastation brought about by intruders, started on 5th May 2000, when the Josephites Fathers had to run out of the town due to yet another rebel incursion, the buildings were left literally empty of everything except of classrooms desks.
        
        Initially the school was established only for boys. However, at a point in time they started accepting girls in the Science stream. The current number of students’ enrolment for the 2018/2019 Academic Year is 999 students including 7 female students.</p>
